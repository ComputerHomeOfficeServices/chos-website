								<h1 class="comp_name">About Us</h1>
									<p class="center_body">When you need assistance setting up a 
computer or network, fix an existing computer, get onto the Internet, or
 want to become more productive, Computer Home and Office Services is 
there to help. The company was established to help setup computer 
technology correctly ... or fix it when it goes awry. We offer 
technological guidance to those who need it.</p>
									<p class="center_body">Computer Home and Office Services was founded by <a href="mailto:avernon@choservices.com">Andrew Vernon</a>
 in 2006 to help individuals and small businesses with their PC's in 
central Iowa. The central motivation for creating the business was to 
provide a locally-based computer services provider that would be more 
responsive than national chains or computer manufacturers.</p>
									<p class="center_body">The primary focus of Computer Home and 
Office Services is on you, the customer.  Computer Home &amp; Office 
Services is dedicated to building long-term relationships with customers
 through quality computer support.</p>

								<h2 class="highlightbar">About The Staff</h2>
									<p class="center_body"><a href="mailto:avernon@choservices.com">Andrew Vernon</a>,
 the owner, has 20 years of experience working with a variety of 
computers and has spent 10 years as a computer programmer.  Andrew 
received his Bachelor of Science (in Computer Science) from the 
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Since then, Andrew has 
worked to develop software in the trucking, land development, and 
telecommunications industry.</p>
									<p class="center_body">Andrew is most familiar with Windows 
computers, but his PC experience goes back to the "old days" of MS-DOS. 
 In college, he also worked with a type of computers that are unlikely 
to be seen in a home or small office environment -- mainframes.  Since 
then, he's also worked with Unix- or Linux-based machines, typically in a
 business environment, but he's seen Linux used in the home environment,
 too.  Andrew enjoys working with computers from a variety of 
manufacturers.</p>
									<p class="center_body">Mr. Vernon has worked with a variety of 
software.  Usually, he works with familiar software titles like Word, 
Excel, and OpenOffice.  At other times, he has also worked with 
technical applications like AutoCAD and MicroStation as well as 
Mathematica.  On the side, he's also worked with more esoteric pieces of
 software like LaTeX, CVS, and SilkTest.  Andrew enjoys working with it 
all.</p>
