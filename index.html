								<h2 class="comp_tag">Computer Home and Office Services helps individuals and small businesses solve their computer problems.</h2>
									<p class="center_body">Computer Home and Office Services can 
help in a variety of situations. Computer Home and Office Services is 
committed to customer service.  Its primary mission is to serve you, the
 customer. Since everyone's situation is unique, a number of different 
services are available to suit <em><strong>your</strong></em> needs.  We're continuing to evolve to provide new services.</p>
									<p class="center_body">Andrew Vernon founded Computer Home and 
Office Services in 2006 to serve the computer needs of individuals and 
small businesses in central Iowa.  Andrew has over ten years of work 
experience in the computer field.</p>

								<h2 class="highlightbar">Services</h2>
									<p>Computer Home and Office Services specializes in Microsoft Windows-based PC's and can help in a variety of situations.</p>
									<p>Services include:</p>
									<ul class="servicelist">
										<li>Backing up and restoring data</li>
										<li>Hardware installation - CD/DVD or hard drives, modems, video cards, memory, or other pieces of hardware</li>
										<li>Troubleshooting (either hardware or software)</li>
										<li>Computer Tutoring</li>
										<li>Wireless network and ISP setup</li>
										<li>Virus and Spyware removal</li>
										<li>Document and database templates (for MS Office, OpenOffice, and other productivity suites)</li>
									</ul>

								<h2 class="highlightbar">Helpful tips just for you</h2>
									<p>Through this web site, you are also able to obtain 
information about fixing commonly encountered and easy-to-fix problems. 
 Check back often for updates.</p>

									<p>Things that you can (and should) do yourself:</p>
									<ul class="tipslist">
										<li>Backup your computer - or at least your most important 
files on a regular basis. I could give you several reasons why you'll 
need one, but you'll likely need it for the reason that no one will 
predict.</li>
										<li>Get important updates from Microsoft, if not 
automatically.  Microsoft regularly provides updates on the second 
Tuesday of every month.  Occasionally, a critical update will ship 
sometime in between.</li>
										<li>Use antivirus and antispyware software and keep them up to date against the latest threats.</li>
										<li>Use a firewall - Windows Firewall if necessary, but preferably a better one!</li>
									</ul>

									<h3 class="tipsheadline">Got viruses or spyware?</h3>
										<p>Of course, the best option is avoid trouble before it 
starts by having an antivirus program, one (if not two) antispyware 
programs, and a good firewall.  These types of programs should have 
automatic updates turned on. Be wary of any unexpected emailed downloads
 - even if it's from people you know and trust. Please schedule a weekly
 scan of the entire machine's hard drive(s).</p>

											<h3>Need an inexpensive alternative to Microsoft Office?</h3>
												<p><a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice</a> is a 
downloadable program, which offers a free alternative to Microsoft 
Office.  One also needs to download a compatible Java runtime to use 
OpenOffice, which is also free.  OpenOffice has garnered increased 
interest nationally as "open formats" may be required by some state 
governments in the near future. Note that certain additional features 
may require a relatively inexpensive fee.  OpenOffice is a good 
alternative to Microsoft Office. <strong>You can even <em>give it a free trial</em> (before you buy it <em>at no cost</em>).</strong>
  Generally, one should be able to open documents (with OpenOffice) 
created by MS Office, but a free conversion program may be required in 
some cases.</p>
